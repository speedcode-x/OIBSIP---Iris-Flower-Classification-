# Iris Flower Classification

Iris flower has three species, versicolor and virginica which differs according to their measurement. Train a machine learning model that can classify the flowers based on measurement.

The Iris Flower Classification project aims to create a machine learning model that categorizes iris flowers into their respective species using specific measurements. The three species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—each have unique characteristics based on these measurements.

## Hypothesis

+ Null Hypothesis (H₀)
The mean petal length is the same for all three species of iris flowers.

+ Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
At least one species of iris flowers has a mean petal length that is different from the others.

The Null was rejected because the p-value was 3.0 

## Conclusion
Random Forest model has been selected as the final prediction model.

In conclusion, the Iris flower classification project successfully employed Random Forest (tuned) as the final prediction model to classify Iris species. The project's outcomes have practical implications in the field of botany and offer valuable insights into feature importance for species differentiation. Further refinements and enhancements may lead to even more accurate and reliable classification models in the future.
